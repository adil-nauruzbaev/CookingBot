# CookingBot

The goal of the project development was to create a simple and effective culinary application based on ChatGPT and visualization neural networks.
For this purpose, all the features of modern cooking applications and websites were implemented.
You can easily get a step-by-step recipe for many unique dishes with the ingredients you have, or you can simply describe your tastes or today's wish and get a list of what you will definitely like! Or maybe you wanted to know and cook the favorite dish of a movie star or historical figure? With this application would also perfectly cope, the space for your culinary fantasy from now on is not constrained by anything!
A social interaction system (ratings, comments, likes, reposts, etc.) has also been integrated into the app.
